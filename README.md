A time tracking application, intended to be used on a Windows 10 IoT Core device (like raspebrry pi) with a touch screen. The application's purpose is to make time- tracking on the job easier, by presenting a set of tasks and that you can easily just select and at the end of the day you'll be presented with a schedule of what you have been doing.
Future functionality might include integration with productivity increasing techniques like pomodori, for example.
